# CExNum
Unlimited BCD numbers for C++, Working with int numbers
Just creat a number!
Both:
  CExNum num1{12};
and
  CExNum num1{"12"};
work.

To cout a number you can use:
  CExNum.disp();

Working with the class itself is really easy.
Also it seems that all operators are included! (Such as ++, <, ==, = ans ...)

It'll be great plusure to develop this clas more and make it work faster, better and more memory-friendly!
